          "description": "Written by our new analyst Alex Sampson A recap of scaling technology Rather than solely scaling Ethereum through native Layer 1 (L1) architecture changes, the Ethereum community has pushed for a rollup-centric roadmap. Layer 2s (L2s) are third-party solutions that exist in conjunction with the main blockchain. As we’ll touch on later, this second layer is critical to the network’s development - you can only “boost” scalability once. From state channels, sidechains, and plasma, the industry and market has largely converged on Optimistic Rollups (ORs) and Zero Knowledge Rollups (ZKRs) as the preferred method. Rollups execute transactions outside of the L1 blockchain and send the data back to the main Ethereum network. As such, rollups’ primary function is to address two bottlenecks for Ethereum - data and computation (e.g. fraud proofs or SNARKs).",
